/**
 * @page SoDa::MailBox MailBox: A simple thread-to-thread communication class. 
 *
 * This was derived from classes originally developed for SoDaRadio.
 * The advent of smart pointer support in C++ made the old
 * implementation look pretty crusty. Earlier implementations also
 * assumed the existence of a buffer allocator, to recycle created
 * objects. This didn't prove to be all that useful. In the case of a
 * large std::vector, for instance, the buffer allocator was *less*
 * efficient and speedy than just creating each vector when needed.
 * 
 * The multithread model here assumes a set of threads sharing a common
 * address space. Threads may put messages into a mailbox that are then
 * readable by any other thread that subscribes to the mailbox.  This is
 * a bit of a mixed metaphor, but imagine messages as magazines, threads
 * as subscribers, and mailboxes as the thing to which the magazines get
 * delivered.
 * 
 *  (Long ago, there were "publishers" who gathered up information on
 * a common topic, or for readers with a common interest. This stuff
 * would be written down and then printed on "paper." Many sheets of
 * paper would be stuck together, almost like a book -- but
 * thinner. (For an example of a "book" see a museum near you. It
 * might be called *the something* Library.) These not-quite-books
 * would be carried to each person who paid for it, *subscribers* on a
 * regular basis. They would be left at each subscriber's house kinda like
 * Amazon's *subscribe and save* thing.)
 *
 * The SoDa::MailBox class provides a mailbox that accepts and delivers
 * messages of a single type (named when the mailbox is created). Each
 * message sent will be received by *all* subscribers, even the originating
 * subscriber. 
 *
 * For an example, take a look at MailBoxTest.cxx. 
 * 
 * After usign the SoDa::Options class to parse the command line, 
 * the example creates a mailbox and a std::shared_ptr to it (mailbox_p).
 * In this example, all messages for this mailbox are vectors of ints.  
 * 
 * \snippet MailBoxTest.cxx create a mailbox
 * 
 * The example actually creates a '''shared_ptr''' to the mailbox. It
 * is a *really* bad idea to pass a pointer to an object created on
 * the stack to a thread. It is possible that the object might go out
 * of scope in its creator before the thread is done with
 * it. Allocating a MailBox with '''new''' and passing a pointer to
 * the resulting heap allocated object is much safer. Using a
 * '''shared_ptr''' will ensure that the MailBox isn't destroyed until
 * all threads and other pointer users have "let it go."
 * 
 * Then it creates a set of threads, using the C++ thread class. 
 * Each thread executes a single function called "objMailBoxTest."
 * The function is passed a pointer to the mailbox, a number of messages
 * to send, and the total number of threads participating in the test. 
 * 
 * \snippet MailBoxTest.cxx create threads
 *
 * Each thread subscribes to the mailbox, and then waits for all the other
 * threads to subscribe. (Each thread waits at a barrier:)
 *
 * \snippet MailBoxTest.cxx subscribe and wait
 *
 * In this example, each thread puts '''num_msgs''' messages into the
 * mailbox.
 * 
 * \snippet MailBoxTest.cxx send messages
 *
 * Once each thread has sent its messages, it will get, in turn, each
 * message that was posted to the mailbox. All threads will receive
 * All messages, even their own.
 * 
 * \snippet MailBoxTest.cxx get message
 * 
 * The call to '''get''' is non-blocking. If there are no messages in
 * the mailbox, '''get''' will return a nullptr.  Also, see that the
 * '''get''' method takes a "subscriber id." This is the id that was
 * returned by the '''subscribe''' method. Calling get with a
 * different subscriber id will screw things up, in all likelihood.
 * 
 * The '''get''' method returns a shared pointer to a message. The
 * shared pointer is important, as when its value changes or it goes
 * out of scope, the reference count for the message is
 * decreased. When the last subscriber has read and disposed of the
 * message (by setting the pointer to nullptr or just letting it go
 * out of scope) the storage for the message will be reclaimed (the
 * message will be destroyed.)
 * 
 * Because of this mechanism, if one of the subscribers to a mailbox
 * stops reading the mail (calling '''get''') that subscriber's
 * mailbox will grow, filling with unread messages. The other
 * subscribers will proceed unimpeeded, but the waiting messages take
 * up storage and can't be freed until the laggard subscriber catches
 * up.
 *
