SoDa Signals really needs a good cmake file for FFTW. 

Fortunately this exists:

I've changed it a bit so it can be installed at
<install_root>/whatever/cmake/SoDa_FFTW/...
I didn't want to use just the plain FFTW package name in case something
better comes along, but I needed the package to appear in the normal
cmake library path for users of SoDaSignals to be able to link without a
whole lot of fooling around.

Thanks again to Wenzel Jakob and Patrick Bos for a nice piece of work.
